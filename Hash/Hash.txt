Hashing / Hash Table – Short Notes
1️⃣ What is Hashing?
    Hashing is a technique to store and retrieve data efficiently using a hash function.
        Converts key → index in an array
        Goal: O(1) average time for insert, search, delete

2️⃣ Why use Hashing?
    Fast lookup & insertion
    Handles large datasets efficiently
    Ideal for dictionaries, sets, caching, counting frequencies

    Applications:
        Dictionaries & symbol tables
        Caching (LRU, memoization)
        Counting occurrences
        Detect duplicates
        Cryptography (hash functions)


3️⃣ Hash Table Properties
    Uses array + hash function
    Each element is a key-value pair
    Handles collisions (two keys → same index)


5️⃣ Collision Handling

When two keys map to the same index:
    1. Chaining (Linked List)
        # Each bucket stores a list of key-value pairs
        table = [[] for _ in range(size)]


    2. Open Addressing
        Linear probing: try next slot
        Quadratic probing: jump by squares
        Double hashing: second hash function
